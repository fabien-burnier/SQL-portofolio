# SQL Portfolio – Real-World Query Practice

This repository contains a series of SQL challenges based on datasets provided in Alex the Analyst's SQL Bootcamp. Each challenge is designed to simulate real-world business questions, such as customer behaviour, sales trends, and operational insights. All queries are written independently as part of my skills development as an aspiring data analyst.
